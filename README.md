### ReactTransitionGroup

> In addition to the normal lifecycle hooks that tell us when a component mounts,
> updates, and unmounts, ReactTransitionGroup gives us access to `componentWillENter`,
> `componentWillLeave`, and a feww others. Notice something familiar?
>
> `componentWillEnter` is the same as D3's `.enter()`, `componentWillLeave` is the
> same as D3's '.exit()', and `componentWillUpdate` is the same as D3's `.update()`.
